# Manual Checks

Our DBs are fairly static, so setting up notifications manually isn't a bad way to do it.  I wanted to document what I did here.



Go to https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home
Click on the sidebar option "Event Subscriptions"
Create Event Subscription

Name: prod-readreplica-alerts
Send notifications to: ImprevSlack
Source Type: Instances
Enabled: Yes
Event Categories: Select Specific
    (availability, deletion, failover, failure, maintenance, read replica)

Instances: Select Specific
    (select all with -readreplica in their name)



Create Event Subscription

Name: prod-cluster-erros
Send notifications to: ImprevSlack
Source Type: DB Clusters
Enabled: Yes
Event Categories: Select Specific
    (failover, failure)
